## "scriptable" branch of [lwouis/alt-tab-macos](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/)

Made for use with [DockAltTab](https://dockalttab.netlify.app) (adds window previews to the MacOS dock)... it does so by sending AppleScript commands to AltTab.


# [AppleScript Dictionary / Docs](https://github.com/steventheworker/alt-tab-macos/blob/scriptable/AltTab.sdef)
#### <u>basic commands</u>
- **hide**: Hide Overlay/UI.
- **show**: Show all app windows. (Regular AltTab shortcut)
- **showApp**: Show specific app's windows. (ignores blacklist)
    - appBID: The bundle identifier of the app whose windows you want to show.
    - x: X-coordinate (optional)
    - y: Y-coordinate (optional)
    - dockPos: (optional) Helps AltTab know where previews will be positioned / clip, (especially for docks on the right (preview 'panel' width is relevant))
- **trigger**: Goes to the next window, without showing Overlay/UI.

#### <u>Miscellaneous / DockAltTab commands</u>
- **appSetting**: Read settings applied on showApp previews.
    - named: Name of the setting. (appsToShow, showHiddenWindows, showFullscreenWindows, showMinimizedWindows, spacesToShow, screensToShow, showTabsAsWindows)
- **countMinimizedWindowsCurrentSpace**: The number of (minimized) windows for an app (FROM the current space, especially useful for keeping minimized windows contained in the space they were originally minimized in).
    - appBID
- **countWindows**: The number of windows for an app (in all spaces).
    - appBID
- **countWindowsCurrentSpace**: The number of windows for an app (in the current space, especially useful for counting hidden windows (otherwise especially hard to do for the current space)).
    - appBID
- **deminimizeFirstMinimizedWindowFromCurrentSpace**: Deminimize app's first minimized window originally minimized on the current space.
    - appBID
- **keyState**: Whether a certain key is being pressed (see if AltTab overlay is absorbing modifier keys)
    - key: Name of the key you want to check the state of.

### example usages:
```tell application "AltTab" to showApp appBID "com.apple.Safari"```

```tell application "AltTab" to showApp appBID "com.apple.Safari" x 0 y 0```

```tell application "AltTab" to hide```

# Other Differences
Some other changes I made out of personal preference / hesitation to submit a pull request:
- ignore some app's windows
    - [BetterTouchTool]() "pinned"/floating windows
    - [Screenhint]() floating windows
- Preview button order: Exit is 1st, Quit is last (opposed to vice-versa)
- faster fading (if fading enabled): 111ms for DockAltTab previews, 333ms for regular previews
- auto reopen controls after closing window (allows click spam to repeat close window quickly)
